Notes:
We're not done balancing and bugfixing so some things are really OP right now.
Loads of small things still are missing (Icons, Models, history etc...)
The game might lag on slow/old pcs because some models are not optimised yet.
The game might freeze for a few seconds, all you have to do is wait.

We can't predict every problem so if you find one post it on rts sanctuary or pm me on voobly/GR (WarriorMario).

Changes:
V1.00 first version on voobly
v1.01 Added the LOSless stage to prevent people from picking a major god after they see which map it is
v1.02 Huge one
-New siege units for the Natives that works like the trebuchet of AoE2.
brief explanation:
Create the mobile version of the unit->Build the Siege unit->Mobile unit dies when the siege unit is build and back Siege unit trains a transform unit->Siege unit dies when the transform unit is created->transform unit transforms into the Mobile unit. Another thing is that you can choose between 3 different types of ammunition: Normal,Trees,Herdables.
Normal ammo gives the same bonuses as siege units have.
Trees ammo is average vs units and buildings and has a shockwave effect that does not stun.
Herdable ammo is good against units bad against buildings.
Their range is quite small now but that will be changed in the future and we might even go back to 1-2 different types of ammunition but we'll see. They're still using placeholder models (OP landboats) but you can still distinguish them by their projectiles and names.

-New models
-Some data adjustments
-Reduced the filesize a bit
v1.021 Added the .dll file and some new models
v1.022 Added some more models and textures fixed the invisible siege units (land#2-15)
v1.023 Added variations to the Inca units and some balance attempts
v1.03 Many things are added to replace older stuff but almost nothing is removed yet.
-Favor generation might change from favor trees to human sacrifice and eventually animal sacrifice. now both ways are available.
-Veteran Eagle Warrior got removed and will be replaced by a age 4 unique unit which is the Apusquispay for the Incas. The apusquispay will be a melee unit with a longer range than normal melee units have.
-Sea Serpent got disabled and replaced by the water giant. The sea serpent might return later as a water MU instead of a semi-hybrid one.The water giant is not final neither.
-Thunderbird got added as an age 3 MU, its not close to being done tho.
-Frog Warrior (known as Aglebemu and is displayed in the minor god chac portrait) got added as an age 3 MU has some animations and some textures with a nice effect. (old pc wrecker)
-Stone Coat got added as an age 4 MU, eventually it will be able to eat humans and grow in strength but for now its a cyclop with a stone texture^^.
v1.031 Some godselection improvements
v1.032 Improvements and some new things
-The Native Land siege units should work better now
-Reduced the lagg caused by the water giants and gave them a cool ability
-changed some Native gp data.
-Added a new model and textures for the training grounds.
v1.033 bunch of fixes and added some things
-Added a new gp for Pachamama. still lacks a death animation.
-fixed the herdable los
-favor trees might not be removed but they will be reworked for sure.
v1.034 FIXED THE AI a bit and some other stuff. Hopefully voobly accepts it!
-UI Completed (Credits to Nottud, esanta)
-Fullscreen Rainfall added (Terrible failure so far ^^)
-added new language pack that works like an addon and can be installed manually without changing anything about the normal game.
V1.035 some fixes and probably a lot of new/old problems too.
-Added an age 1 settlement model for the Natives.
-Added new models and textures for the Shaman unit.
-Changed the data back so the settlement problems should be fixed now.
-AI can start a game but then does not know how to continue.
-The ThunderBird has a new model with an animated texture. The animated texture will be improved later because this was just to test it.
