Age of Mythology : The Natives

Non voobly installation:
Copy everything from the folders into the folders that have the same name in your Age of Mythology folder. Uninstalling manually is a pain.

Voobly installation:
Go to your game directory and create these directories "Age of "Voobly Mods\AOMT\Data Mods\Unofficial Expansion alpha WIP" 'Voobly mods' folder should already be there if you have Voobly installed the others could also be there if thats the case then just don't try to make another.
If you've created the "Unofficial Expansion alpha WIP" copy and paste all the mod files in there.
Then run the mod through voobly.
